Task Description: Automated Deployment of a Two-Tier AWS Infrastructure
 
Objective: Candidates are required to automate the deployment of a two-tier infrastructure on AWS, consisting of a web server (EC2 instance) and a SQL database (RDS). The deployment process should leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and be executed through a CI-CD pipeline.
 
Requirements:
Web Server:
Type: AWS EC2 Instance
OS: Linux
Application: WordPress (Download â€“ WordPress.org) installed and configured
Accessibility: Publicly accessible (HTTP initially, with HTTPS implementation earning extra points)
Security: Located in a public subnet; security group allowing only necessary traffic (HTTP or HTTPS)
Database:
Type: AWS RDS (MySQL or PostgreSQL)
Accessibility: Hosted in a private subnet
Security: Security group configured to allow connections only from the web server on required ports
CI-CD Pipeline:
Automation of the entire deployment process
Use of AWS CloudFormation templates to define and create the infrastructure components
Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
All infrastructure components must be defined and managed as code
Visibility and Accessibility:
The default WordPress website should be visible and accessible from the public internet
Security and Network Configurations:
Proper configuration of security groups and subnets to ensure secure access
HTTPS implementation is optional but preferred for additional points
 
Success Criteria:
Successful deployment of a functional two-tier architecture (web server and database) in AWS, automated via CI-CD pipeline.
WordPress site is publicly accessible and operational.
Compliance with specified security and network configurations.
